# 2D-Heat-Equation-Using-Finite-Difference-Method-with-CUDA
This code is designed to solve the heat equation in a 2D plate with CUDA-Opengl. After solution, graphical simulation appears to show that how the heat diffuses throughout the medium within time interval selected in the code. Solving the 2 Dimensional Heat conduction equation in the generalized form, we used FEM technique.
